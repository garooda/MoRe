Recommendation system recommends you the items based on past activities this is known as __Content Based Filtering__ or the preference of the other user's that are to similar to you this is known as __Collaborative Based Filtering__ .

#### What is Cosine Similarity ?
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two items are. Mathematically it calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multidimensional space. Cosine similarity is advantageous when two similar documents are far apart by Euclidean distance(size of documents) chances are they may be oriented closed together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
